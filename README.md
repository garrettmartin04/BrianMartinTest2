# BrianMartinTest2
Name: Brian Martin

Description: I created multiple branches for different tasks given by the professor, within each branch I worked on the issues that I assigned myself in the main git project. Once complete, I merged them with the main branch and the issues were automatically marked as completed. This repo is just showing work with GitHub and its functionality.
